# Image Captioning — Final Project

A neural network system that generates natural language captions for images. The model takes an image as input and produces a descriptive sentence as output, bridging visual understanding and natural language generation.

## Overview

This project implements an image captioning system trained on a dataset of 8,000 images, each paired with five human-written captions. The system uses an encoder-decoder architecture to map visual features to natural language descriptions.

- `notebooks/data_and_training.ipynb` — data loading, model definition, training process, model saving
- `notebooks/inference.ipynb` — caption generation on unseen test images, with success and failure case analysis
- `src/` — modular source code (dataset handling, vocabulary, model architecture, training utilities)
- `checkpoints/` — trained model weights

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-final-project.git
   cd image-captioning-final-project
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset:
   - **placeholder for now**, we will add the exact dataset link and folder structure here once finalized

4. Download pretrained model weights (optional, if not retraining from scratch):
   - **placeholder for now**, we will add the Google Drive / release link here once the model is trained

## How to Run

1. Open `notebooks/data_and_training.ipynb` to walk through data loading, model architecture, and training.
2. Open `notebooks/inference.ipynb` to generate captions on test images using the trained model.

**placeholder for now**, we will add more detailed run instructions (expected runtime, GPU requirements, etc.) here once the pipeline is finalized

## Model Architecture

**placeholder for now**, we will add a description of the encoder (e.g. CNN-based image feature extractor) and decoder (e.g. RNN/LSTM/Transformer-based caption generator) here once the architecture is implemented

## Training Details

**placeholder for now**, we will add details on training setup here — number of epochs, batch size, optimizer, loss function, hardware used, training time, etc.

## Results

**placeholder for now**, we will add quantitative results (e.g. loss curves, evaluation metrics) and qualitative examples (sample generated captions) here once training is complete

## Failure Case Analysis

**placeholder for now**, we will add examples of incorrect or nonsensical captions here, along with brief analysis of why the model failed on these cases

## Contributions

**placeholder for now**, we will add a breakdown of who worked on what (data pipeline, model architecture, training, inference, documentation) here

## License

**placeholder for now**, we will add a license here if needed (e.g. MIT) — optional for a course project
